##  Telnet or SSH 
In the real Network Telnet are moslty ignored and always ssh is used on Real world Networks, A simple reason being that it is telnet which creates a serious problem that all data is sent to telnet network as a clear text including credentials. Therefore, Anyone can easily sniff with the help of Man-In-the-middle attack. However, An ssh can encryt all data transmitted between SSH client and SSH server. So, You need to confiure Symmetric Encryption. 


# Misson

- If domain is already configured then mark the domain name to solve the next lab

Thank You
