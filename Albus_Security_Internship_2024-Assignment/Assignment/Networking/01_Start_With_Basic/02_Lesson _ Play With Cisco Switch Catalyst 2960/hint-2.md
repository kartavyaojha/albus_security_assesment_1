## Introduction to Cisco Catalyst 2960 Switch 

Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series of switches is a modern switch model series, but not the current model. Current model series of switch is Cisco Catalyst 2960-XR, but in both of these nothing much is different. Therefore, If you learn about 2960, then you can easily configure and troubleshoot 2960-XR too.
These switches are full-featured, low-cost wiring closet switches for enterprises. The Interface type, as worked in command on these series, is FastEthernet, Gigabit and Ethernet. Overall, Cisco catalyst 2960 Suppose multiple speeds (10/100/1000).  To access a interface, You would need to define the interface type and number (Fastethernet 0/1).

## Mission
 - In this lab, You will experience the Mac learning process, switch forwarding logic too. 

## Hint 
 - Whenever you make some changes on the switch then you should always go to see the configuration that you done.
 - In this lab, You will get a key to access the next lab, Therefore, You would need to solve this lab.
