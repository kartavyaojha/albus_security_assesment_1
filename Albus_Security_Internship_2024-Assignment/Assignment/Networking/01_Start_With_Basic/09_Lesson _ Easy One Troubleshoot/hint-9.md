## Introduction to Exec-Timeout

The Cisco "exec-timeout' command sets a specific time of the inactivity timer. Basically, If there is no user input within the indicated time, then a session will be closed. Therefore, To use this command you can change the time slap for timeout. However this is commonly used in lab, but not in production. You might want to use the special value of 0 that means timeout wil never be down.


## Misson
- Change the timeout configuration on both switches.


## Hint 
-lab-8 contains the key, therefore go there and try to analyise the things
