## Introduction to Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)

We all know that a lan acts all devices in the same broadcast domain. Therefore, it is also right that a lan and a broadcast domain are basically the same. Therefore, If someone wants to make two broadcasts you'll need to bug two different switches to work with two broadcasts. Wait Technology is always developed to make things better that is why In switches. A new Functionality was found that is known as VLAN with the help of this functionality, You can create multiple broadcast domains on a single switch.


## Misson 
 - In this lab, You need to check that all vlan are configured perfectly or not.

## Hint 
 - Sometimes when you see the configuration of all vlans you can't troubleshoot anything. Therefore, see the particular vlan configuration to troubleshoot a single thing on it.

Thank You
