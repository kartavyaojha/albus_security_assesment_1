## Introduction about Packet Tracer

Cisco packet tracer is a User-Friendly network simulator that can be used to improve your network skills. In this simulator, Network Engineer create network topology with lot's of networking device (Router,Switch,etc), Iot, Home devices, etc. And start configuring these devices through CLI, GUI too and also enhance their troubleshooting skills without buying these devices and networks services. Cisco Packet tracer is created by Cisco. 

The main purpose of Cisco packet tracer simulator is to provide a best way for network enigneer, students to learn the fundamentals of networking, devices configuration and troubleshooting. Therefore, We've decided to make a lab that is already configured but the configuration is not done properly meaning that you need to find the way to configuration of the labs according the level. 

## Mission  

 - As we are starting our lab, In this lab You'll need to find the username and password to access the switch CLI.

## Hint
 - Running-Config is a system config file that is found in the networking device's memory that acts like RAM. So, all process will be deleted if the device loses their power. Therefore, You need to store all the configuration on startup-config file that acts like a ROM. Because running-config file is not saved. However to save this. You'll have to use copy command on enable mode.
