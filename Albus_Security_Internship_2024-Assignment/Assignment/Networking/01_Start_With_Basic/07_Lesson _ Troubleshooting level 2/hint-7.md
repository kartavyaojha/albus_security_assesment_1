## Layer 1 problem occurs on Working Interfaces

The most common problem that occures on Working Interfaces is Duples mismatch and The Most interesting thing on that can be to find a duplex mismatch but it can be super hard, even more than finding a speed mismatch. Reason is that In a speed Mistatch the Interface status should be displayed down, but In duplex Mismatch the interface status will be in connected as (up/up) status. Therefore, it is hard to find the extact problem. However, to troubleshoot this problem you need know about counters.


# Misson 
- Check if the Network is working properly or not.

# Hint 
-- Focus on late Collision Counter.
