## Configured an IPV4 Address on Switch

The main reason to enable ipv4 address on layer 2 switch is to allow telnet or ssh access over the network and to allow other IP-Based Management protcol. In layer 2 switch the ipv4 address doesn't work anything related to switch forwarding. It simply supports Some protocols. A Switch may need same kind of logic as of the IP Setting of a User-PC.But We all know that a switch doesn't have hardware NIC and it has lot's of ethernet ports instead of assigning Ip address on it. However a setting looks like a host on switch.

- As a Senior network engineer, You'll have a task to check all the configuration that was done by a junior Network Engineer.

## Hint 
- To Solve the Lab, You have to correct the ip address on device according to vlans.
