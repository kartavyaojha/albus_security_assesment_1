## Introduction to VLAN Trunking Protocol 

Vlan trunking is a algorithm of VLAN tagging concept, In which switch encapsulate the ethernet header on vlan trunk=king header, but how switch identifies wether they can encapsulate the ethernet header to vlan trunking or not. So Between the switches we need to configure a interface as trunk meaning that if switch wants to forward the frame on this interface, the switch will be encapsulate to the ethernet frame into vlan header. In VLAN Headerthere is filed called VLAN Identifier(VLAN ID) that tells the switch that the frame is comes to which vlan.  in Today's Netowkring world, 902.1Q protocol is used in switch for Vlan Trunking.


## Misson 
- As a Network Engineer, Your responsbility is to check that vlans are working properly.

## Hint 
- Suppose, You want to down an interface but You don't not want to go to the switch and remove a cable, For this Network Engineer a Uses Shutdown command on that interface to disable a interface.
- All interfaces are default set on dynamic auto, that's sometimes make problem.
